SweDikt is a small application that can be used when you're starting to learn
swedish. You can use it to enter words in the dictionary as you learn them and
then play small quizzes that test your knowledge.

See Help->About in the application to read a short tutorial on how everything
works.

Features' summary as of v0.1:
- Can create or open an existing dictionary
- Can add/edit words to/from the dictionary. No possibility of deleting
  words yet, sorry! The whole edit dictionary code has to be redone so you don't
  have to push 9000 buttons to do what you want.
- Simple and detailed quizzes.

See CHANGELOG for details
